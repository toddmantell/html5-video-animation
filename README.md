# html5-video-animation

This repo is an exercise for doing a simple animation in HTML5/React/GSAP with babel, webpack, and styled-components.

To run the exercise, clone this repo, then type:
```npm i```

followed by:
```npm start```

At which point, webpack will rebuild the js bundle (this is just so the bundle is fresh).

You should then be able to access the application by running:

```http://localhost:3000 or http://127.0.0.1:3000```
